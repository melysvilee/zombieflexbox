I choose to do the flexbox froggy after ! TO me, it was more simple to understand. Though I over course loved flexbox zombies, it jjust felt way too overwhelming and too many assests to focus on. I feel it would've worked better as an actual game instead of a teaching tool. I also feel like the little explanations help more? So if anything I'd say flexbox froggy first to actually learn, and then flexbox zxombies for practice.
